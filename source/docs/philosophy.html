# Philosophy
{{> partial-edit path="docs/philosophy"}}
Our philosophy is to provide a simple, yet powerful library for facilitating the development of system automation software across multiple platforms. By writing code which is well thought-out and loosely-coupled, we can deliver a centralized reference for developers looking to replicate the functionality of Robot into their own projects; without having to dig through endless amounts of documentation to do so. Whether it be a small snippet of code or an entire application, we cannot wait to see what the community can achieve with Robot.
