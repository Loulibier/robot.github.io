# About
{{> partial-edit path="docs/about"}}
Robot is a simple cross-platform library designed to facilitate the development of system automation software. The library works by abstracting away all platform-specific differences into a single, robust API compatible with most desktop operating systems. The API is available in both [C++](//github.com/robot/robot) and [Node](//github.com/robot/robot-js) flavors and supports Windows, Mac and some distributions of Linux. Robot is production-proven with no additional dependencies, it is powerful enough to be the primary tool for many professionals yet simple enough for learning and experimentation.
