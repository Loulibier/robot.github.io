			<h1 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h1>
<p><a class="edit" href="//github.com/robot/robot.github.io/edit/master/source/docs/conduct.html">Edit on GitHub</a>Like the technical community as a whole, the Robot developers and the community is made up of a mixture of professionals and volunteers from all over the world, working on every aspect of the mission - including mentorship, teaching, and connecting people.</p>
<p>Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to. This code applies equally to founders, mentors and those seeking help and guidance.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t an exhaustive list of things that you can&#39;t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it&#39;s intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.</p>
<p>This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Robot project. This includes Gitter, the issue tracker and any other forums created by the project team which the community uses for communication. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person&#39;s ability to participate within them.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Be friendly and patient.</strong> We understand that we all have different levels of experience or knowledge in many diverse fields, be it technical or nontechnical in nature. We also have areas of knowledge we are eager to expand, and we want to be a community where people can not only contribute, but feel comfortable to ask questions as well and learn along the way. If someone is wrong, or says something accidentally offensive, respond with patience and try to keep it polite and civil. Remember that we all were newbies at one point.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Be welcoming.</strong> We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Be considerate.</strong> Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you make will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we&#39;re a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else&#39;s primary language.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Be respectful.</strong> Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It&#39;s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the Robot community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the Robot community.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Be careful in the words that you choose.</strong> We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren&#39;t acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Violent threats or language directed against another person</li>
<li>Discriminatory jokes and language</li>
<li>Posting sexually explicit or violent material</li>
<li>Posting other people&#39;s personally identifying information</li>
<li>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms</li>
<li>Repeated harassment of others</li>
<li>Any unwelcome sexual attention</li>
<li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>When we disagree, try to understand why.</strong> Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and Robot is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we&#39;re different. The strength of Robot comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re wrong. Don&#39;t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn&#39;t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.</p>
